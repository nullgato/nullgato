# The Dossier
Just a silly little (trans) femme in your silly little screen.  
Or big screen.   
Probably not a little screen?  

I'm a software engineer of about a decade and a half. I work professionally as a mobile developer, but my actual interests are in game development. Most of my GitHub consists of web based projects though because there's a whole lot going on before I can spend time on game dev. üòÖ

I make lofi! You can find it on Spotify/Apple Music and other streaming services. It's also on Bandcamp if you feel like owning the music!

Other than that I enjoy playing music and have a guitar and bass I play fairly frequently, and I also enjoy video games! A few MMOS: FFXIV, RuneScape, Mabinogi; retro gaming (generally between N64/PS1 - Xbox 360/PS3 eras); and some other games! I love Clone Hero and Fortnite Festival, and RPGs like Baldur's Gate and classic BioWare. ‚ù§Ô∏è
